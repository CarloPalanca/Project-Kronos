# Project-Kronos
Purpose: an entry to the ECES-IECEP UE-Caloocan ASICUP Competition, as well as the 2024 Erovoutika Robolution

A 3 kg autonomous sumo robot with a 20 × 20 cm frame designed for competitive dohyo matches. It features ultrasonic distance sensing for real-time opponent detection, adaptive attack strategies, and precise motion control—optimizing strength, speed, positioning, and reaction timing for maximum dominance in robotics combat competitions.

Details of project construction are demonstrated on the Wiki section of this repository.
